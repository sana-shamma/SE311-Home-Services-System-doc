# Home Service System 🚀🏡

## Project Summary 📄

The **Home Service System** is a comprehensive application designed to simplify access to various home services, catering to the needs of users by connecting them with reliable service providers in their locality. This project, developed as part of the Software Requirement Engineering course, aims to leverage technology to enhance the home service experience for consumers. 💡✨

### Purpose 🎯

The primary objective of the Home Service System is to facilitate quick and efficient access to a wide range of home services, ensuring that consumers can find and book the services they need with minimal hassle. This includes services such as homemade food delivery, babysitting, tutoring, and painting. 🍲👶📚🎨

### System Overview 🌐

The Home Service System integrates various external components such as Google Gmail, Google Maps, and payment systems (e.g., Apple Pay) to provide a seamless user experience. The system ensures secure authentication, real-time tracking of service providers, and secure payment processing. 🔒📍💳

### Key Features✨

- **Service Booking:** Users can browse and book various home services directly through the application. 📅
- **Real-Time Tracking:** The system uses Google Maps to provide real-time tracking of service providers. 🚗
- **Secure Payments:** Integration with payment systems ensures secure and convenient payment options. 💳
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for ease of use, the system supports both mobile and desktop views. 📱💻


## Project Artifacts 🗂️

The project deliverables include a **Request for Proposal (RFP)** and a **Software Requirement Specification (SRS)** documents📄.

### Request for Proposal (RFP) 🤝

The RFP document lays the groundwork for the project. It defines the Project Name, states the Objective, identifies the Stakeholders, outlines the Functional Requirements, Quality Requirements, and Constraint Requirements, sets the User Interface Priorities, and specifies the Technologies to be Used.

### Software Requirement Specification (SRS) 📋

The SRS document is structured into four main sections. The first section provides an introduction, covering the Purpose of the System, System Identification, System Overview, Related References, and an overview of the SRS Document Structure. The second section delves into various aspects of the system design. This includes the Product Perspective, which a **Context Diagram** illustrating how the system will interact with external systems. It also covers System Interfaces (APIs), **Overall Use Cases**, User Characteristics, Constraints, and Assumptions and Dependencies. The third section is dedicated to detailing the specific Requirements of the project. This includes a thorough exploration of the Software Product Features, with **Detailed Use Cases and Tabular Descriptions for each Functional Requirement**. Additionally, this section covers the External Interface Requirements, breaking them down for User, Hardware, and Software interfaces, and provides **Requirement Traceability Table**. The fourth and final section lists all Acronyms and Abbreviations used throughout the document.Rounding out the SRS are Appendices that provide information on the User Interface (UI), **Sequence Diagrams**, and **User Stories**.
